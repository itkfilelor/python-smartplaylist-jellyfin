# python-smartplaylist-jellyfin
Use Jellyfin API to create a 'smart' playlist
Since the API is more or less the same, this should also work with Emby. (YMMV)

# Disclaimer
This is NOT a plugin. I am not very good with .NET (or python for that matter :grin:).
this uses http-api calls to the server instead of internal calls. If anyone can turn this into an internal plugin or just plain make it better, be my guest.
This is only tested on my linux server, but SHOULD work on Windows/Mac as well.

# Future (Maybe)
For now this works for my use case. If interest is shown, I may work on other options such as reverse sorting and different elements to sort against (i.e folders, artist, etc).
As of right now, it sorts playlists by air date and time (optional) in ascending order.
